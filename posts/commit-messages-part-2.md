# Commit-messages where they are used,

In hindsight it would have been better to address this topic first, rather than assume that the reader has some prior existing knowledge about source-code version management systems.

Source code version management systems are tools used mostly by software developers to collaborate and track changes to the files and projects they are working on.

A common SVM is git, this was the SVM the examples in my previous post used.

There are many other SVM systems, some dating back to the 1970's and most if not all of them facilitate writing commit messages in some way or another.
