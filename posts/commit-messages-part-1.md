# Commit messages: part 1
As of recent my blog posts have been a bit scatterbrained covering as I've basically picked a topic I managed to think of that day and wrote a little about it. See my **[previouse blog](https://marcmcintosh.github.io/holidayCheck-Blog/)** for examples.

This week will be a change of pace, instead of covering a little ground in a lot of topics, one topic will be more thoroughly dissected.

This week it's the how, what, where and why of commit messages.

Four topics five days, should suffice for this week considering the research involved, there are plenty of blogs along the lines of __...tips for great commit messages__, but few about their purpose, anatomy, history or pragmatic approaches and resources. 

**Lets see how well this works**
