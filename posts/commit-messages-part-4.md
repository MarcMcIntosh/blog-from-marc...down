# Commit messages part 3, Why?

The purpose of writing a commit message is to briefly state the changes that have been made to file and why. A few situations these brief message can be useful are:
+ Finding out what you or someone else was recently working on.
+ Keeping track of ticket numbers or issues.
+ Being able to describe the purpose of the changes made.
+ Enables a some-one unfamiliar with the language or project to understand how the code base is progressing.

A good way to think about commit-messages are like sticking a post-it note or writing something on a post-card before sending some-one a gift through the mail, it's allows them to know from whom, why and what has been sent before they even have to look at the package.
